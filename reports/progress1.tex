\begin{abstract}
The new generation of applications requires the processing of terabytes and petabytes of data. This processing has 
largely been achieved by distributed processing architectures and methodologies, driving the rise of companies such as 
Google, Amazon and Yahoo, which have embraced such technologies over the past decade and made them a central part of 
their business models. The increased importance of large scale data processing and a corresponding explosion in 
alternative storage architectures and service strategies requires computer science researchers and professionals to 
become well versed in the available alternatives and trade-offs in making technological architectural choices these 
areas. While storage technology has evolved significantly over the past five years, a deep understanding of both 
technical and business storage issues has lagged behind as many in these fields still view data storage as a mundane 
activity still the purview of back office technocrats. The current trend in distributed cloud storage and the focus of 
delivering IT infrastructure and applications bundled with data storage has led to an “as a service” model being used to promote such products.

Increasingly in organizations, storage is being regarded as a profit center and not an overhead. The ability to redeploy
content quickly will create new revenue opportunities for content owners. This will include the ability to manufacture
(customize) new content through software agents to prepopulate anticipated user demands and fully embrace the any content, anywhere at any time business model. Going
forward, storage architectures will remain just as complicated as they have always been, with several classes of solid 
state drives (SSDs) being optimized for different roles. A key difference, however, will be that the only spinning 
devices prevalent in the storage cabinets (wherever they are ultimately located) will be in the cooling fans.

The intent of our project is to examine the current state of both core storage and related service offerings on both a 
technical and business level to understand (1) what is technically available, (2) what are current research and 
developmental directions in storage technology, and (3) how core storage architectures are being coupled with associated services to
produce bundled storage product offerings that purport to add value above and beyond core offerings. We believe that by
performing this analysis and the subsequent implementation of a distributed proof of concept storage model, we will gain
a better understanding of evolving storage technologies as well as the tradeoffs that need to be made when implementing
bundled storage services in a production environment.
