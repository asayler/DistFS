@article{Weil:2012p1008,
author = {Sage A Weil}, 
journal = {Dissertation},
title = {Ceph: Reliable, scalable, and high-performance distributed storage},
abstract = {As the size and performance requirements of storage systems have increased, file system designers have looked to new architectures to facilitate system scalability. The emerging object-based storage paradigm diverges from server-based (e. g. NFS) and SAN-based storage systems by coupling processors and memory with disk drives, allowing systems to delegate low- level file system operations (e. g. allocation and scheduling) to object storage devices (OSDs) and decouple I/O (read/write) from metadata (file open/close) operations. Even recent object- based systems inherit a variety of decades-old architectural choices going back to early UNIX file systems, however, limiting their ability to effectively scale.This dissertation shows that device intelligence can be leveraged to provide reliable, scalable, and high-performance file service in a dynamic cluster environment. It presents a dis- tributed metadata management architecture that provides excellent performance and scalability by adapting to highly variable system workloads while tolerating arbitrary node crashes. A flexible and robust data distribution function places data objects in a large, dynamic cluster of storage devices, simplifying metadata and facilitating system scalability, while providing a uni- form distribution of data, protection from correlated device failure, and efficient data migration. This placement algorithm facilitates the creation of a reliable and scalable object storage ser- vice that distributes the complexity of consistent data replication, failure detection, and recovery
across a heterogeneous cluster of semi-autonomous devices.These architectural components, which have been implemented in the Ceph distributedfile system, are evaluated under a variety of workloads that show superior I/O performance, scalable metadata management, and failure recovery.},

title = {Time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system},
abstract = {The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.},
